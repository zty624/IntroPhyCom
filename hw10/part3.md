# HW10 Part3 Explanation

It's obvious that the Similarity distribution is directly related to the pattern number. when the num is below 200, the similarity is fixed on 1, which means all the noise can be ignored. When the num is above 300, the similarity gradually becomes to a (gaussian?) distribution. The shift occurs at about num=275.
